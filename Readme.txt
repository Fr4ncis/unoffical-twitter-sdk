Unoffical Twitter SDK

While creating an app which needed simple twitter interactions i found that all of the exisiting libraries used OOB signon. I also found that all the libraries looked different to the facebook login method. What i have done is using the code from the facebook-ios-sdk built something that behaves the same as the facebook-ios-sdk without using OOB login for oAuth. 

The license is Apache 2.0, as i copied a lot of code from the facebook-ios-sdk. All of the copied code is in TwitterDialog.h/.m

It should be fairly self explanatory to use, but it was written quickly and might still be buggy. If you know of any bugs please tell me so i can fix them, or submit a pull request.
